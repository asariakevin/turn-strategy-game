# most strategy game play is tightly linked to the map
# the map keeps track of the terrain , distance and units(characters)
#
# the maps in this chapter will be represented with a 2D grid
# each square will have a slot for terrain type and for a unit
#
# all squares should have a terrain type , but many squares won't be
# occupied by a unit at any particular time
#
# terrain objects tell the game whether a square is covered in forest,
# mountains or rivers
#
#
# different Terrain types need to be presented distinctly in the interface . A name should be sufficient for this
#
